			The Developer Club was founded in September of 2017 with the objective to promote the 
				digital infrastructure in the Copenhagen International School community. The club 
				aims to pursue a range of projects that will collectivly enhance the school and it's community.
				As the club believes technology lies at the heart of well being in today's society, we felt 
				there was a desperate need for technological betterment in our community. The clubs founders wanted
				to take on that challenge and actively accelerate the digitalization of the CIS ecosystem, through
				increased interconnectivity, transparency and better UI/UX of our digital platforms.
